Branch names should follow the syntax `author/branch-type/branch-name`. For example, `zuck/feature/harvesting-user-data`.

Don't forget to run `yarn prisma migrate dev --name=init` after making changes to the schema!

Create a `seed.json` file in the root to populate the database with initial data. See `seed.example.json` for an example. We have collectively worked on seed.example.json to ensure that it is up-to-date with the schema and contents are relevant.
